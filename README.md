A brief review and analysis of Watershed Management of Sundarban Ecosystem area.

Watershed Management is a procedure or analysis or characterization of the condition,processes, interaction, within a watershed. Watershed displays a basin topography which can be as small as a footprint or large enough to encompass all the land that drains water into a river and finally enters sea and ocean. I chose Sundarban Area for watershed management for preserving and enhancing the natural capital of Sundarban. It is a tremendous nature based solution for dealing with these hazards and fostering the resilience of the communities. Here I use Srtm Dem 30 metre of Sundarban Area and calculate the basin area of Sundarban.
